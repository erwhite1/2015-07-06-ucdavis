## What is the shell?

The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered
with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell.

* For most bioinformatics tools, you have to use the shell. There is no
graphical interface. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics you're
going to need to use the shell.
* The shell gives you *power*. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and
more quickly.  When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times,
knowing how to use the shell is transformative.
* To use remote computers or cloud computing, you need to use the shell.

  Unix is user-friendly. It's just very selective about who its friends are.

## How to access the shell

The shell is already available on Mac and Linux. For Windows, you'll
have to download a separate program.

On Mac the shell is available through Terminal  
Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal  
Go ahead and drag the Terminal application to your Dock for easy access.
