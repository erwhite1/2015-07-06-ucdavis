# Version control

#Teaching Git - 1

1. Take 30 seconds and explain to your neighbor what your project workflow is. What tools do you use? How do you keep notes on what you did?
2. Does your workflow change when you collaborate with other people? How do you communicate?

#What is Version Control?

* How easy would it be to grab the code you used to develop a project/manuscript from last week? Last year? Last 5 years?
* How much work would you lose if your laptop was stolen/damaged?
* If you deleted part of your manuscript or analysis, then later realized that you wanted to keep it in, would you have to rewrite it?
* If you were collaborating with someone on a manuscript or some code and someone rewrote something, how easy would it be to track down who changed it and why?

__Version control...__

* keeps track of changes to a file/folder
* keeps a backup of changing files
* stores of history of the changes
* allows you to go back to previous versions of your project
* allows you to work efficiently from multiple computers in multiple locations
* allows many people to make changes concurrently (collaboration!)

__Do you currently use some kind of version control?
## What is your day-to-day workflow?
- What is the shell?
- How do you access it?
- How do you use it?
  - Getting around the Unix file system
  - looking at files
  - manipulating files
  - automating tasks
- What is it good for?
- Where are resources where I can learn more? (because the shell is awesome)

## What is the shell?

The *shell* is a program that presents a command line interface
which allows you to control your computer using commands entered
with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

There are many reasons to learn about the shell.

* For most bioinformatics tools, you have to use the shell. There is no
graphical interface. If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics you're
going to need to use the shell.
* The shell gives you *power*. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and
more quickly.  When you need to do things tens to hundreds of times,
knowing how to use the shell is transformative.
* To use remote computers or cloud computing, you need to use the shell.

  Unix is user-friendly. It's just very selective about who its friends are.

## How to access the shell

The shell is already available on Mac and Linux. For Windows, you'll
have to download a separate program.


Mac
---  
On Mac the shell is available through Terminal  
Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal  
Go ahead and drag the Terminal application to your Dock for easy access.

Windows
-------
For Windows, we're going to be using gitbash.  
Download and install [gitbash](http://msysgit.github.io) on your computer.
Open up the program.
